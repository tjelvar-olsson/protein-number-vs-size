# Protein number versus size

Mini-project to investigate whether or not the average size of a protein
increases with the number of proteins in a genome.

Intuitively one might think that as organisms become more complex they need a
larger variety of proteins and that these proteins themselves become larger.

However, the complexity of an organism is a rather subjective concept. Let us
therefore ignore that term and simply try to determine if there is a
correlation between the number of proteins in a genome and the average size of
those proteins across all species.
